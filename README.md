• <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lorenzo.tanada/viz/NewsEngagementSentimentAnalysis/NewsDashboard" target="_blank">News Engagement & Sentiment Analysis</a> - In this project, we analyze a dataset of news articles for engagement and sentiment. Engagement can be measured for articles that contain a selected keyword, in this case "Brexit", and it can also be measured by Sources. In order to automatically generate the sentiment of an article's title, we use VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) which is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media, news, and other domains. Filtering can be done by Pulblished Date and Source Name.
